I have put in QnA format to make it easier to read.\nWhy focus on building domain expertise in fintech? With the advancements we’re seeing in artificial intelligence and development tools, the ability to translate well-defined requirements into code is no longer the primary differentiator it once was. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang takes it further and says\n“I think that people ought to learn all kinds of skills,” and compared code to juggling, playing piano, or learning calculus. However, “programming is not going to be essential for you to be a successful person.\"\nWhat’s becoming increasingly valuable is how well you can understand and refine those requirements in the first place. This is where deep domain knowledge comes into play.\nWhen I joined Meta, formerly Facebook, I had the opportunity to speak with a director during his first visit to our London office. I asked him a simple but crucial question:\n“How can I be successful in this role?”\nHe said:\n“You need to make sure you deeply understand the work we are doing here come to terms with revenue recognition, month close, statutory reporting, and all that.”\nBy developing this deep domain knowledge, I was able to have more meaningful conversations with our business, tax, and assurance teams. It allowed me to ask better questions that often led to better solutions.\nBNPL and trade financing Why do you believe that financing will continue to be a hotbed of innovation in the coming future? I believe financing will continue to be a hotbed of innovation due to the changes we see in the market as we collect more data.\nFor example, when I joined Twiga Foods, we had a strict no-credit policy because of past issues with sales agents giving informal credit and not being able to collect payments.\nHowever, in the field, you see the mismatch between this policy and reality. Small-scale kitchens, like a roadside kitchen, where the cook prepares Chapatis, can turn around the entire bale and make a tidy sum by the end of the day, with margins over 200%.\nThis scenario highlighted a missed opportunity for businesses like ours and showed the potential for innovative financing solutions benefiting both sellers and buyers.\nThe story ends well with the SokoLoan product, but that’s for another day.\nSince moving to the UK, I’ve seen the ability to purchase anything with financing options. You can get financing for a shirt, a phone, or a device from Amazon. I believe these services are coming to Africa soon, especially with increased smartphone adoption, cheaper internet, and e-commerce growth.\nWhat challenges do you foresee in implementing these financial innovations in rural areas? Connectivity remains a key issue. Large parts of the continent still don’t have good connectivity. However, this gap is quickly closing. We’re seeing that as long as you have power, internet is also coming with that. Companies like Starlink are entering our markets and becoming successful, providing a different way of getting connectivity to rural areas.\nWe’ve also seen text-based innovations really take off. M-PESA, for example, was able to ride on top of the fact that you only need your SIM card for it to work, and it’s still successful today.\nI anticipate more of these types of innovations coming in. Right now in Europe, there are discussions around considering internet as a utility, putting it at the same level as water and electricity. I think Africa won’t be far behind in getting on board with these kinds of facilities.\nThat said, we’ll need to address challenges like digital literacy, regulatory hurdles, and building trust in new systems. But given the rapid pace of change we’re seeing, I believe these challenges can be overcome.\nHow might traditional banks adapt to compete with these new digital financial services? This ultimately comes down to the question of trust. Banks still maintain a lot of trust in our communities. This gap between a new, unknown business and a well-known brand means that banks are really well-placed to lead these innovations. We are already seeing this with JPM Chase product and in Kenya Absa bank bank Timiza\nI think the key for banks is to think beyond just what the bank needs, and focus on making it easy for customers to do customer-to-customer transactions or business-to-customer transactions. The potential for innovation here is huge.\nBanks can leverage their established reputations to launch digital services under their trusted brand names. They can also create hybrid models, combining digital offerings with their existing physical infrastructure to provide a seamless experience that fintech startups can’t match.\nRemittances What do you think the effect will be of remittances in the future? I think that remittances will continue growing significantly in the future. The last time I checked, the global remittance market was close to $900 Billion , and this trend is likely to persist.\nSince moving to the UK, I’ve found that practically every Kenyan expatriate I’ve talked to has plans to either move back home, spend a substantial amount of time there, or invest back home. This isn’t just a Kenyan phenomenon – it’s common among Africans and other immigrants worldwide.\nThis continued connection to home countries drives remittance growth. However, there are still significant challenges and opportunities for innovation in this space. For example:\nInvestment barriers: If I wanted to invest in assets back home, such as purchasing stocks on the Nairobi Stock Exchange, there’s no easy way to do that from abroad. The current systems are inconvenient and costly.\nTransaction costs: While getting money from London to Kenya is practically free, once it lands in an M-Pesa account, moving it to purchase anything incurs significant costs. These costs are often passed on to the consumer through higher prices or transaction fees.\nInnovation potential: There’s substantial space for innovation in reducing transaction costs and offering more innovative products that compete on customer experience rather than just price.\nAs these challenges are addressed, we’re likely to see remittances play an even larger role in economic development and cross-border financial flows.\nHow do you think technology might play a role in reducing these transaction costs for remittances? The base cost for transactions is nearly zero, even for big players like Safaricom. The challenge is offering innovative products that add value while maintaining low costs.\nTechnology can play a crucial role by:\nImproving efficiency: Utilizing blockchain or other advanced technologies to streamline the remittance process. JP Morgan has done a lot of work in this area with its JPM Coin\nEnhancing user experience: Developing user-friendly apps and interfaces that make sending money as easy as sending a text message. See how Sendwave does it\nData utilization: Leveraging big data and AI to optimize currency exchange rates and reduce fraud, thereby lowering operational costs.\nIntegration: Creating seamless integrations between remittance services and local financial systems to reduce friction and costs.\nHowever, technological innovation alone isn’t enough. We also need regulatory changes to support these businesses. For example, Nigeria’s supportive regulatory framework has led to the growth of successful payment startups. Close to 90% of these innovative fintech solutions originated in Nigeria due to this environment. eg: Wave, Paystack, Flutterwave, etc.\nWhat specific regulatory changes do you think are needed to support these innovative fintech solutions? To foster innovation in fintech and remittances, we need regulatory frameworks that are both supportive and protective. Key areas for regulatory change include:\nOpen Banking: The UK government’s approach supports open banking, allowing banks to share data with each other and other providers. This enables the creation of tools on top of existing financial infrastructure. For example, a wallet interacting with your bank account could offer credit based on transaction data, even without a steady job. Plaid is a good example of this.\nProportional Regulation: Creating products that allow people to save, invest, and plan for their future, even without a full bank account. Do you real need a barber to open a bank account? This might involve tiered KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements based on transaction volumes or service types.\nRegulatory Sandboxes: Safe spaces where fintech startups can test innovative products without the full regulatory burden, allowing controlled experimentation. We already have Konza Village why stop there.\nCross-border Harmonization: Standardizing regulations across African countries to facilitate easier expansion of successful fintech solutions.\nConsumer Protection: Updating laws to protect consumers in the digital financial ecosystem while still allowing for innovation.\nDigital Identity Systems: Implementing robust digital ID systems to simplify customer onboarding and verification processes.\nBy implementing these regulatory changes, we would likely see higher financial inclusion and education. It would allow for the development of products that cater to a broader range of customers, including small shop owners who might not have the time or resources to comply with complex banking requirements.\nIt’s a wrap A lot is happening in Fintech creating a lot of opportunities for software engineers. I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you agree with my thoughts? Do you have any other thoughts?\nLet me know!\n",

<p>I think that remittances will continue growing significantly in the future. The last time I checked, the global remittance market was close to <a href="https://www.migrationdataportal.org/themes/remittances#:~:text=This%20growth%20is%20much%20slower,in%202024%20(ibid.).">$900 Billion</a> , and this trend is likely to persist.</p>

<p>The base cost for transactions is nearly zero, even for big players like Safaricom. The challenge is offering innovative products that add value while maintaining low costs.</p>
<p>Technology can play a crucial role by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Improving efficiency: Utilizing blockchain or other advanced technologies to streamline the remittance process. JP Morgan has done a lot of work in this area with its <a href="https://developer.payments.jpmorgan.com/docs/treasury/global-payments/capabilities/jpm-coin-system">JPM Coin</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhancing user experience: Developing user-friendly apps and interfaces that make sending money as easy as sending a text message. See how <a href="https://www.sendwave.com/en-gb">Sendwave</a> does it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data utilization: Leveraging big data and AI to optimize currency exchange rates and reduce fraud, thereby lowering operational costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration: Creating seamless integrations between remittance services and local financial systems to reduce friction and costs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, technological innovation alone isn&rsquo;t enough. We also need regulatory changes to support these businesses. For example, Nigeria&rsquo;s supportive regulatory framework has led to the growth of successful payment startups. Close to 90% of these innovative fintech solutions originated in Nigeria due to this environment. eg: Wave, Paystack, Flutterwave, etc.</p>

<p>To foster innovation in fintech and remittances, we need regulatory frameworks that are both supportive and protective. Key areas for regulatory change include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Banking: The UK government&rsquo;s approach supports open banking, allowing banks to share data with each other and other providers. This enables the creation of tools on top of existing financial infrastructure. For example, a wallet interacting with your bank account could offer credit based on transaction data, even without a steady job. <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a> is a good example of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proportional Regulation: Creating products that allow people to save, invest, and plan for their future, even without a full bank account. Do you real need a barber to open a bank account? This might involve tiered KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements based on transaction volumes or service types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulatory Sandboxes: Safe spaces where fintech startups can test innovative products without the full regulatory burden, allowing controlled experimentation. We already have <a href="https://konza.go.ke/">Konza Village</a> why stop there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-border Harmonization: Standardizing regulations across African countries to facilitate easier expansion of successful fintech solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consumer Protection: Updating laws to protect consumers in the digital financial ecosystem while still allowing for innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital Identity Systems: Implementing robust digital ID systems to simplify customer onboarding and verification processes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By implementing these regulatory changes, we would likely see higher financial inclusion and education. It would allow for the development of products that cater to a broader range of customers, including small shop owners who might not have the time or resources to comply with complex banking requirements.</p>

<p>A lot is happening in Fintech creating a lot of opportunities for software engineers. I would love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you agree with my thoughts? Do you have any other thoughts?</p>
<p>Let me know!</p>
